# ML Bootcamp Capstone Data

## Contains Datasets for the following projects

### 1. Generate banking customer synthetic data

As privacy concerns and laws restrict the usage of data of real bank customers it is necessary to have artificial customers generated so that data usage is less restricted.

**Application:** For projects built on bank customer data such as customer segmentation, behaviour prediction, and personalized marketing.

**Dataset** can be found in `1_banking` folder.

### 2. Generate artificial perfume

The perfume market is an over $50 billion dollar industry and there are over 800 new perfumes launched each year. Yet, not every perfume is a financial success or even reaches the same success as another perfume of the same brand.

**Application:** Can be used for marketing purposes such as seeing what potential perfumes have the ability to reach a threshold of customer demand.

**Dataset** can be found in `2_perfume` folder.

### 3. Generate artificial reviews for coffee

Tons of products have tons of reviews online these days. A product Iâ€™ve been particularly interested in as of late is coffee. As such, it would be interesting to generate artificial reviews to do with coffee.

**Application:** Perhaps can be used for detecting whether a review is artificial or not. Otherwise, its primary purpose is solely as an entertaining web application.

**Dataset** can be found in `3_coffee` folder.
